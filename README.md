VYAPARI- A supply-chain cum buisness management app, built on the secure principles of blockchain technology.
The app lets you manage your inventory, personnel, orders, transactions, locate your orders, see ledger, and access your financials as well. The catch over here is that, the orders or transactions we create are stored in the blockchain as smart contracts. 

Some advantages of using blockchain are-
1. Immutability: Blockchain transactions are immutable, meaning that once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This makes the transaction record tamper-proof and ensures its integrity.

2. Decentralization: A blockchain is a decentralized system, meaning that there is no central authority controlling it. This eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as banks or financial institutions, and reduces the risk of fraud and corruption.

3. Transparency: Blockchain transactions are transparent, meaning that all participants in the network can see and verify them. This increases trust and reduces the risk of disputes.

4. Security: Blockchain transactions are secured using advanced cryptographic techniques. This makes them more secure than traditional database systems, which can be vulnerable to hacking and cyber attacks.

5. Efficiency: Blockchain transactions can be processed faster and more efficiently than traditional database systems, which can be slow and resource-intensive.

Overall, storing transaction data in a blockchain provides a more secure, transparent, and efficient way of recording and verifying transactions, making it ideal for applications that require high levels of trust and security, such as financial transactions, supply chain management, and voting systems.

# Methodology

1. The app is designed using Flutter and Dart.
2. To implement backend, Google Firebase has been used with its Firestore, Authentication and Storage services.
3. Solidity language has been used to create smart contracts.
4. Truffle and Ganache has been used to deploy contracts and create a local blockchain.
5. Web3dart and http are some dart packages that have been used to connect Flutter app with Ganache.
